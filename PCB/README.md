### README

**Milestone_2.kicad_sch** shows schematics of the different components in SDR

**Milestone_2.kicad_pcb** puts the components together design in the schematic file to create a PCB with edge mount

The design of the entire PCB consists of a bandpass filter, RF amplifier, Mixer, Audio Amplifier, ADC.
We also included a connector where it will receive the WSPR signal for it to be converted from an analog
signal to a digital one. The bandpass filter will only allow signal with the same frequency of that of a WSPR
signal.}
